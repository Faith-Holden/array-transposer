# array-transposer

My solution for Chapter 7 Exercise 2 of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.

Problem Description:
Suppose that M is a two-dimensional array that has R rows and C columns. The transpose
of M is defined to be an array T that has C rows and R columns such that T[i][j] = M[j][i]
for each i and j. Write a function that takes an array of type int[ ][ ] as a parameter,
and returns the transpose of that array. (Assume that the parameter is a typical 2D array
in which all the rows have the same length.) Also write a subroutine to print a 2D array
of integers in neat rows and columns, and include a main() routine to test your work.
